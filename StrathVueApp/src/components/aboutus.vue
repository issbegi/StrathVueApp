      <H3>HISTORY</H3> Strathmore College was started in 1961 as an Advanced-level Sixth
      Form College offering Science and Arts subjects by a group of
      professionals, who formed a charitable Educational Trust (now the
      Strathmore Educational Trust). Strathmore College was the first in
      Pre-independence Kenya to accommodate all races, religions, and social
      standing. Saint Josemaría Escrivá, the founder of Opus Dei, inspired and
      encouraged them to start the College. In March 1966, the first intake of
      Accountancy students, twenty-five in number, joined the Sixth Form
      students and began preparing for the examinations of the UK-based
      Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA). These first
      Accountancy students were sponsored by Shell East Africa, BAT (East
      Africa), and the East African Breweries. At this time Strathmore College
      was unique as a fully integrated post-Form 4 institution offering both
      academic and professional courses. In October 1982, owing to the increased
      demand from companies for the professional training of their employees,
      the College began evening courses in Accountancy after normal working
      hours, with 60 students sponsored by various companies. In 1986, in
      response to a request by the Trustees, the Government of Kenya donated 5
      acres of land on Ole Sangale Road, Madaraka Estate. The European Union
      (EU) and the Italian Government agreed to back the Madaraka Campus
      project. The donors were keen to support a co-educational College that
      would offer courses in Management and Accountancy. Kianda College, an
      undertaking of Kianda Foundation, which was planning new developments at
      the time, agreed to run their professional courses in the new Madaraka
      campus. Construction of the new campus commenced in September 1989.
      Meanwhile, in January 1991, the Information Technology Centre was started
      in the Lavington Campus to run computer courses leading to the Institute
      for the Management of Information Systems (formerly Institute of Data
      Processing Management) Diploma and Higher Diploma. In January 1992 a
      Distance Learning Centre was opened to offer correspondence courses in
      Accountancy to students who are unable to attend lectures. In January 1993
      Strathmore College merged with Kianda College and moved to Ole Sangale
      Road, Madaraka Estate. <h3>ENROLLMENT</h3> A total population of 4,393
      students(full-time and part-time) studying Accountancy, Administration,
      Commerce, Finance, Management, and Information Technology. <h3>BECOMING A
      UNIVERSITY</h3> In August 2002 the Commission of Higher Education awarded
      Strathmore a Letter of Interim Authority to operate as a University with a
      Faculty of Commerce and a Faculty of Information Technology. The first
      undergraduate students to enroll in these faculties completed their 4-year
      degree course in December 2004 and graduated in August 2005. In June 2007,
      Kenya’s Commission for Higher Education approved the award of a charter to
      Strathmore University. <h3>STRATHMORE UNIVERSITY CHARTERED GAZETTED</h3> The
      University’s Charter was gazetted under the Universities Act (CAP 210B) in
      the ‘Kenya Gazette’ supplement no. 47 (legislative supplement no. 27) via
      legal notice no. 86. The charter details the establishment and functions
      of the University, membership, and governance of the University,
      administration, financial provision, and statutes of the University.
